_A curated list of awesome resources for protecting consumers from harmful products, toxic ingredients, and environmental pollutants._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Overview </summary>

Consumer protection in the context of environmental health focuses on helping individuals identify and avoid products containing harmful chemicals, pollutants, and toxic ingredients. This includes tools and resources for scanning food products, cosmetics, personal care items, cleaning products, and other consumer goods to identify substances linked to health risks such as cancer, hormone disruption, reproductive harm, and allergic reactions.

The rise of consumer protection apps and databases has empowered millions of users to make informed purchasing decisions, leading to significant changes in product formulations by major corporations. These tools typically evaluate products based on scientific databases from regulatory agencies and research institutions worldwide, identifying substances of concern and providing safer alternatives.
